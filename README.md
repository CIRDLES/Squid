The current versions - Squid3-**0.0.n.jar** - prototype the development of the
project-management feature
of Squid.  Squid provides for creating and saving Squid Project files that have an
extension of ".squid" and are intended to save the current sate of work on a project.

The Project menu provides for creating a new project from a single Prawn XML file
or by joining together two Prawn XML files.  The project manager allows for naming the project,
naming the analyst, and reviewing, editing, and splitting the Prawn XML file.

Three tabs show 1) Session Summary, 2) Session Audit, and 3) Manage Spots.
The Session tabs provide a summary and in-depth look at spots, duplicate names for spots,
species statistics, and scans statistics.  The Manage Spots tab supports editing spot names,
filtering spots by name, and setting the project's reference material spots by using the same
filtering feature.  The context menu on the left-side list is accessed by a
right-mouse click and has items for removing a spot and
splitting the Prawn file into two files.  Any modifications to the Prawn file can be saved
to a new Prawn XML file if needed.  Note that saving the project preserves the changes to the
Prawn XML data.

The Project management functionality is a work-in-progress.  We encourage you to
use it to experiment with managing your Prawn XML files by merging, splitting,
and editing them.  Thank you in advance for any suggestions you contribute.
